C++ library enable stack trace from exceptions.

This is proof of concept code, if you are interested, feel free to improve. It is annoying that one cannot get stack trace from exceptions in C++, so this code should allow for this.

This is by no means production code, but as it stands it seems to work, at least with my non-automated tests.
